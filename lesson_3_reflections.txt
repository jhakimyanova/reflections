When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to work from more than one computer (for example from computer at work and from laptop at home...). 
  When I work in team, it's easier to collaborate using remotes.
  When I want to be sure that my code is stored safely in cloud but not only in my local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because automatic updates can break my code. Or they may include changes(new features, etc.) that I do not want to be in my branch. Also when I pull changes manually I know exactly that the code have changed and what are the changes. When it's happen automatically I might not notice it at all.
